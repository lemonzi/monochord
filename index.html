            <h1>MonoChord Demo</h1>
            <p>The outer circles represent a monochord; they span a few octaves. You can directly change their frequency by dragging them. Inner circles act as tuning pegs and allow altering the tuning with more precision; spinning a full turn on the middle one will detune the monochord by about a semitone, and the innermost will make micro-tonal adjustments. Press the button on the middle to play a note on that monochord, or press the space bar to play all of them at once. Have fun!</p>
